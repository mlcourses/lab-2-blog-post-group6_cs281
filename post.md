# Lab X: Doing stuff with hardware!

## Overview and Motivation - Utsav
This week we'll explore...




## 2 to 1 Multiplexer - Long
### Objective
In this first part of the lab, we will simulate a 2 to 1 multiplexer using only AND, OR and NOT gates. The aim here is to demonstrate that any multiplexer can be taken apart into basic Boolean logic. By using just AND, OR, and NOT gates, we can create all kinds of multiplexers, like 2 to 1 or 16 to 1.
### Materials
The materials required for this part are: one circuit diagram, one wiring diagram, a PB-503 breadboard, as well as 3 IC chips: 7404 (NOT), 7408 (AND), and 7432 (OR).
